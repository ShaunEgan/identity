## Public key repository

This repository holds my latest public SSH keys to enable secure actions with me such as:

1. Allowing me SSH access to infrastructure
2. Sending asynchronously encrypted messages
3. Verying communications from myself

Hosting this key on GitHub allows me to easily update and distribute it over `HTTPS`.
